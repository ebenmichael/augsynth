## Overview
This package implements the Augmented Synthetic Control Method (ASCM).
In particular, there are three types of ASCM implemented in this package:

1. **single_augsynth**: The ASCM version of the classic synthetic control approach with a single treated unit.
2. **multisynth**: ASCM that estimates the treatment effect for multiple treated units with staggered adoption.
3. **augsynth_multiout**: ASCM for a single treated unit with multiple outcomes.

For a more detailed description of the main functionality check out:
- [the vignette for simultaneous adoption](https://github.com/ebenmichael/augsynth/blob/master/vignettes/singlesynth-vignette.md)
- [the vignette for staggered adoption](https://github.com/ebenmichael/augsynth/blob/master/vignettes/multisynth-vignette.md)

## Installation
To install this package, first ensure that `devtools` is installed with

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

then install the package from GitHub with

```
devtools::install_github("ebenmichael/augsynth")
```

## Basic usage
To get started, use a panel dataset with an `outcome` measure, a `treatment` indicator, a `unit` indicator, a `time` variable, and an intervention time `t_int`. Then run


```
asyn <- augsynth(outcome ~ trt, unit, time, t_int, data)
```
