\itemize{
   \item{outcome}{Name of the outcome of interest}

If covariates are time-varying, their average value before the first unit is treated will be used. This can be changed by supplying a custom aggregation function to cov_agg.}

\item{data}{Panel data as dataframe}

\item{n_leads}{How long past treatment effects should be estimated for, default is number of post treatment periods for last treated unit}

\item{n_lags}{Number of pre-treatment periods to balance, default is to balance all periods}

\item{nu}{Fraction of balance for individual balance}

\item{lambda}{Regularization hyperparameter, default = 0}

\item{V}{Scaling matrix for synth optimization, default NULL is identity}

\item{fixedeff}{Whether to include a unit fixed effect, default TRUE}
