\usage{
augsynth(form, unit, time, data, t_int = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{form}{outcome ~ treatment | auxillary covariates}

\item{unit}{Name of unit column}

\item{time}{Name of time column}

\item{data}{Panel data as dataframe}

\item{t_int}{Time of intervention (used for single-period treatment
only)}

\item{...}{Optional arguments
\itemize{
  \item Single period augsynth with/without multiple outcomes
    \itemize{
      \item{"progfunc"}{What function to use to impute control outcomes: Ridge=Ridge regression (allows for standard errors), None=No outcome model, EN=Elastic Net, RF=Random Forest, GSYN=gSynth, MCP=MCPanel, CITS=CITS, CausalImpact=Bayesian structural time series with CausalImpact, seq2seq=Sequence to sequence learning with feedforward nets}
      \item{"scm"}{Whether the SCM weighting function is used}
      \item{"fixedeff"}{Whether to include a unit fixed effect, default is FALSE }
      \item{"cov_agg"}{Covariate aggregation functions, if NULL then use mean with NAs omitted}
    }
  \item Multi period (staggered) augsynth
   \itemize{
         \item{"relative"}{Whether to compute balance by relative time}
         \item{"n_leads"}{How long past treatment effects should be estimated for}
         \item{"n_lags"}{Number of pre-treatment periods to balance, default is to balance all periods}
         \item{"alpha"}{Fraction of balance for individual balance}
         \item{"lambda"}{Regularization hyperparameter, default = 0}
         \item{"force"}{Include "none", "unit", "time", "two-way" fixed effects. Default: "two-way"}
         \item{"n_factors"}{Number of factors for interactive fixed effects, default does CV}
        }
}}

\value{
augsynth or multisynth object (depending on dispatch) that contains (among other things):
        \itemize{
         \item{"weights"}{weights}
         \item{"data"}{Panel data as matrices}
        }
}
\description{
The general `augsynth()` method dispatches to `single_augsynth`,
`augsynth_multiout`, or `multisynth` based on the number of
outcomes and treatment times.  See documentation for these methods
for further detail.
